I am a fourth year **Cognitive Science** major.  
Python was my first programming language because it was user-friendly and highly relevant to my major.  
> I first learned about it in highschool, but it was only for AP Computer Science Principles  

I had experience using git in courses that involved group projects. It is safe to say that I have used the commands  
```
git add  
git commit  
git push  
```
numerous times.  

Here is an [example video](https://youtu.be/f1wnYdLEpgI?si=9gcBIxiLXVM9a8eE) that helped me learned more in depth about the 
other useful git commands.  

Here is a [risky link](imgs/fav_img.png) to one of my favorite images.  

This is a list of things I would like to learn from this course:  
- Hosting app on a server
- Developing API
- Learn to use up-to-date frameworks for developing software
- Getting better at presenting ideas
